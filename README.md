This repository, `kruxarth/todo`, currently lacks a `README.md` file. Based on the file structure and language analysis (TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, HTML), this appears to be a full-stack To-Do application organized as a monorepo with distinct frontend and backend services.

Below is a detailed `README.md` file created for this project, including the structure and assumed initialization steps based on standard practices for this technology stack.

# TODO Application (Full-Stack Monorepo)

A simple, full-stack application for managing a list of tasks (To-Dos). This project is structured as a monorepo, separating the client-side user interface (Frontend) from the server-side logic and database connectivity (Backend).

## 🚀 Technology Stack

Based on the languages present in the repository, the project likely uses the following technologies:

| Component | Primary Technology | Assumed Framework/Library |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** (`todo-backend`) | **TypeScript** / **Node.js** | **Express.js** or similar for REST API. |
| **Frontend** (`todo-frontend`) | **TypeScript** / **JavaScript** | **React**, **Vue.js**, or similar framework. |
| **Styling** | **CSS** | Plain CSS or a preprocessor/utility framework. |

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

```
todo/
├── todo-backend/         # Server-side application and API
│   ├── src/              # Source files (e.g., controllers, models, routes)
│   ├── package.json      # Backend dependencies and scripts
│   └── tsconfig.json     # TypeScript configuration
├── todo-frontend/        # Client-side application
│   ├── src/              # Source files (e.g., components, pages, assets)
│   ├── public/           # Static assets (HTML, images)
│   ├── package.json      # Frontend dependencies and scripts
│   └── tsconfig.json     # TypeScript configuration
└── .gitignore            # Files/directories to ignore
```

## ✨ Features

The application is expected to support the core functionalities of a standard To-Do list:

  * **Create** new tasks with a title/description.
  * **Read** (View) the list of all active and completed tasks.
  * **Update** (Edit) the title or description of an existing task.
  * **Toggle Status** (Mark) a task as completed or incomplete.
  * **Delete** tasks permanently.

## 🏁 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have **Node.js** and **npm** (or yarn/pnpm) installed on your system.

  * [**Node.js** (includes npm)](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommended)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kruxarth/todo.git
    cd todo
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for the Backend:**
    Navigate to the `todo-backend` directory and install its dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd todo-backend
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies for the Frontend:**
    Navigate to the `todo-frontend` directory and install its dependencies.

    ```bash
    cd ../todo-frontend
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

4.  **Database Configuration (Assumed):**
    If the backend requires a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL), you may need to set up a `.env` file in the `todo-backend` directory with connection credentials.

      * *Note: Check the `todo-backend` folder for an existing `.env.example` file for exact required variables.*

## 🏃 Running the Project

The application must be run in two separate stages: the backend API server and the frontend client.

### 1\. Run the Backend Server

Start the API server from the `todo-backend` directory. This will typically run on **`http://localhost:3000`** (or a different port specified in the backend configuration).

```bash
cd todo/todo-backend
npm run dev
# or npm start, depending on the setup
```

### 2\. Run the Frontend Client

Start the development server for the user interface from the `todo-frontend` directory. This will typically open the application in your browser on **`http://localhost:5173`** (or a different port).

```bash
cd todo/todo-frontend
npm run dev
# or npm start, depending on the setup
```

The frontend application should now be running and communicating with the local backend API.

-----

## 🌐 API Endpoints (Assumed)

The backend API is expected to expose the following RESTful endpoints for managing tasks:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/api/todos` | Retrieves all to-do items. |
| `POST` | `/api/todos` | Creates a new to-do item. (Requires `title`, `description`) |
| `GET` | `/api/todos/:id` | Retrieves a single to-do item by ID. |
| `PUT` | `/api/todos/:id` | Updates an existing to-do item (e.g., title, description). |
| `PATCH` | `/api/todos/:id` | Toggles the completion status of a to-do item. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/todos/:id` | Deletes a to-do item. |
